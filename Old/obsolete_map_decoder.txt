  (* We want to prove:                                                        *)
  (* cond_prob (received (SNOC d ds)) (sent (SNOC c cs))                      *)
  (*  = cond_prob (received d) (sent c) * cond_prob (received ds) (sent cs)   *)
  (*                                                                          *)
  (* Then we could simply use our inductive hypthesis on the strings of one   *)
  (* less length, and we could easily calculate the inductive step to be      *)
  (* appropriate.                                                             *)

  (* This is intuitively obvious because the value of a given bit is only     *)
  (* affected by the relevant bit that was sent, not by any other bits that   *)
  (* were sent or received.                                                   *)

  (* cond_prob (received (SNOC d ds)) (sent (SNOC c cs))                      *)
  (*  = prob (received (SNOC d ds) and sent (SNOC c cs))                      *)

  (* The tricky part in this proof sketch is proving that                     *)
  (* (received d and sent c) is independent of (received ds and sent cs), and *)
  (* that (sent c) is independent of (sent cs)                                *)

  (* In fact, at least the second of these properties is false, so this proof *)
  (* sketch won't work.                                                       *)
