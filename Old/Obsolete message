Edit: probably disregard this message, I think what Irvin said answers this

Would you be able to elaborate on what you mean when you imply that congruence rules can help in this situation if they can automatically prove the side conditions?

I have the EXTREAL_SUM_IMAGE congruence rule mentioned above in my context. Then I have the proof state: 

```
    0.  ∀x. x ∈ S ⇒ my_func x = new_func x
   ------------------------------------
        ∑ my_func S = ∑ new_func S
```

It should be trivial to automatically prove the side condition x ∈ S if we know that x ∈ S.

The simplifier cannot automatically prove this, even though I have added the congruence rule using [cong].

However, simp[EXTREAL_SUM_IMAGE_CONG] can automatically prove this.
