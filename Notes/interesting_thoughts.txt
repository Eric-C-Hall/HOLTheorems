If you write your initial proof on top of an untrusted library, and you would prefer to have a simpler, easier to validate definition, you can simply write your own, simpler definitions for the concepts and prove that the library's concepts are equivalent to your own concepts. In this way, you can still use the library and any proven theorems within the library, but you are only depending on the simpler-to-validate definitions that you yourself wrote, and you aren't depending on the correctness of the corresponding definitions within the library, which may be defined in more complex and harder-to-verify ways.
