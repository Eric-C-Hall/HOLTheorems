  (* TODO: bs may not lead to the state s, so we cannot immediately apply the
     generalized viterbi correctness theorem here. We must first prove that
     our specific choice of s will give a better result than any other choice
     of s, so that we can deal with cases in which bs leads to another state.
     Then we can finish our proof by showing that for an arbitrary valid state,
     if we consider all paths bs leading to that state, the path which was
     designed to be optimal is, in fact, optimal.*)
